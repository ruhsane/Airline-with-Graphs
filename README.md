# Airline-with-Graphs


## Problems:
1. see if it is possible to take every possible flight route exactly once and end up at the original airport where we started the trip
2. find shortest path from city A to city B
3. find a city that has the most amount of connecting cities

## Modeling:
1. is it Eurolian or not
2. BFS
3. maximum degree of the graph

## Resources used:
sample data from https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/tree/master/sample-data
